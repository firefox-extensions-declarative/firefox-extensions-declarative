First, before you can use these extensions, you need a browser that is built with `MOZ_REQUIRE_SIGNING=""`.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of these:
- [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)
- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/channel/desktop/developer/)
- [Firefox Nightly](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/channel/desktop/#nightly)
- [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)
- [Glide](https://glide-browser.app/)
- Many other Firefox forks.

## Installation
